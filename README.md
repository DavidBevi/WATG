</p>

### ✅ WATG combines WhatsApp Web & Telegram Web in a super-light app, with:
- ✅ Native window with reactive UI<br/>
- ✅ Native notifications (WPN)<br/>
- ✅ Switch view between `WA` / `TG` / `Hidden` [*Click on tray icon*]<br/>
- ✅ Unread count in tray icon <img src="https://github.com/DavidBevi/WATG/blob/main/demo-pics/tray-all.png" height="13px"> and taskbar / titlebar (text)

### ❌ But WATG is still in beta because:
- ❌ My testing was very limited and I don't know if WATG is stable and functional. [Any feedback is very welcome!](https://github.com/DavidBevi/WATG/issues/new)

### ⚠️ You also should know:
- ⚠️ Whatsapp doesn't have a "narrow-layout", but I want it, so I made [this userstyle](https://github.com/DavidBevi/violentmonkey-scripts/blob/main/whatsapp-web-responsive.js) to enable it. **However** it's not complete, for example I can't find a way to hide one pesky thin vertical line. You can cope with it and enlarge the window when needed, or mod my mod and then rebuild WATG.
- ⚠️ WATG is made with Tauri, but I'll make and share executables only for **Windows**. For other systems you can have a look at the [**build tools and instructions**](https://github.com/DavidBevi/WATG/blob/main/src-tauri) and see if you can do it by yourself.
