### WATG combines WhatsApp Web & Telegram Web in a super-light app, with:
- [x] Native window with reactive UI (using [my WA mod](https://github.com/DavidBevi/violentmonkey-scripts/blob/main/whatsapp-web-responsive.js))
- [x] Hide-in-tray ability
- [x] Unread count in tray icon <img src="https://github.com/DavidBevi/WATG/blob/main/src-tauri/src/icons/tray-all.png" height="12px">
- [x] Unread count in taskbar / titlebar (text)
- [ ] Custom notifications
- [ ] Customizable zoom settings


> [!WARNING]
> WATG is still quite rough. It's almost ready for a beta but you should be aware that:
> - This app is made with Tauri, but it's only for **Windows** because I'm unable to make it cross-platform 😢
> - Whatsapp doesn't provide a "narrow-layout", but I made [a mod](https://github.com/DavidBevi/violentmonkey-scripts/blob/main/whatsapp-web-responsive.js) to inject it.
> 
> If despite everything you download [WATG-0.6-Alpha.exe](https://github.com/DavidBevi/WATG/blob/main/executables/WATG-0.6-Alpha.exe?raw=true) good luck, and tell me how it goes! 😁


> [!TIP]
> - **WATG** can [**show Whatsapp**] - [**show Telegram**] - [**be Hidden**]. To cycle through these 3 states **click on the tray icon**.

WATG is a project I'm making for myself, but I'd like others to be able to use it and customize it further.<br/>
