### ‚úÖ WATG combines WhatsApp Web & Telegram Web in a super-light app, with:
- ‚úÖ Native window with reactive UI<br/>
- ‚úÖ Native notifications (WPN)<br/>
- ‚úÖ Switch view between `WA` / `TG` / `Hidden` [*Click on tray icon*]<br/>
- ‚úÖ Unread count in tray icon <img src="https://github.com/DavidBevi/WATG/blob/main/src-tauri/src/icons/tray-preview.png" height="13px"> and taskbar / titlebar (text)

### ‚ùå But WATG is still in beta because:
- ‚ùå Theming is not implemented yet
- ‚ùå Probably other important stuff that I didn't think about yet

### ‚ö†Ô∏è You also should know:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Whatsapp doesn't provide a "narrow-layout", so I had to make [a mod](https://github.com/DavidBevi/violentmonkey-scripts/blob/main/whatsapp-web-responsive.js) to enable a good experience even when the WATG window is narrow. I can't find a way to hide one pesky thin vertical line, and some elements of the UI are not yet modded, so you'll have to cope with it or mod my mod and then rebuild WATG.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WATG is made with Tauri, but I'll make and share executables only for **Windows**. For other systems you can have a look at the [**build tools and instructions**](https://github.com/DavidBevi/WATG/blob/main/src-tauri) and see if you can do it by yourself.
