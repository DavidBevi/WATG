# ![WATG logo](https://github.com/DavidBevi/WATG/blob/main/source-code/src-tauri/icon.png?raw=true) WATG: Whatsapp+Telegram <sub><sup>v0.3-Alpha</sup></sub>

> [!WARNING]
> - This app is made with Tauri for **Windows** (I'm unable to make it cross-platform ðŸ˜¢)
> - This repo is meant as **a backup of my dev builds**, because WATG is not ready for production yet!
> - There's a compiled executable [here](https://github.com/DavidBevi/WATG/blob/main/executables/WATG-0.3-Alpha.exe), but I don't know if it works on other machines. **If you try to use it please tell me how it goes!**


> [!TIP]
> - **WATG** can [**show Whatsapp**] - [**show Telegram**] - [**be Hidden**]. To cycle through these 3 states **click on the tray icon**.
