<p align="center">v0.7 Beta - for Windows 10/11</p>

### ‚úÖ WATG combines WhatsApp Web & Telegram Web in a super-light app, with:
- ‚úÖ Native window with reactive UI (using [my WA mod](https://github.com/DavidBevi/violentmonkey-scripts/blob/main/whatsapp-web-responsive.js))
- ‚úÖ Switch view between `WA` / `TG` / `Hidden` [*Click on tray icon*]
- ‚úÖ Unread count in tray icon <img src="https://github.com/DavidBevi/WATG/blob/main/src-tauri/src/icons/tray-preview.png" height="13px">
- ‚úÖ Unread count in taskbar / titlebar (text)

### ‚ùå But WATG is still in beta because:
- ‚ùå Notifications are not managed yet
- ‚ùå Links are not handled by the web browser yet
- ‚ùå Probably a bunch of other stuff that I didn't think about, yet

### ‚ö†Ô∏è You also should know:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Whatsapp doesn't provide a "narrow-layout", so I had to make [a mod](https://github.com/DavidBevi/violentmonkey-scripts/blob/main/whatsapp-web-responsive.js) to enable a good experience even when WATG has a narrow window. I can't find a way to hide one pesky thin vertical line, and some elements of the UI are not yet modded, so you'll have to cope with it or mod my mod and then rebuild WATG.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WATG is made with Tauri, but I'll make and share executables only for **Windows**. For other systems you can have a look at the [**build tools and instructions**](https://github.com/DavidBevi/WATG/blob/main/src-tauri) and see if you can do it by yourself.

### If you download [WATG-0.7-Beta.exe](https://github.com/DavidBevi/WATG/blob/main/executables/WATG-0.7-Beta.exe?raw=true) good luck, and [tell me how it goes](https://github.com/DavidBevi/WATG/issues/new)! üòÅ
